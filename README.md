InsideGPT is a project that allows you to explore and use OpenAI's GPT-3 language model for generating text.

Getting Started
---------------

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the following tools installed on your system to be able to run the project:

-   Python 3.7 or higher
-   Poetry (<https://python-poetry.org/>)
-   Streamlit (<https://docs.streamlit.io/getting_started.html>)

### Installing

To install the dependencies, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:



`git clone https://github.com/RemiPelloux/InsideGPT`

1.  Change into the newly created directory:



`cd InsideGPT`

1.  Install the dependencies using Poetry:



`poetry install`

1.  Run the following command to start the Streamlit app:



`streamlit run main.py`

You should now be able to access the app at `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.

Using the App
-------------

The user interface of the app is simple and straightforward. You can type in a prompt and generate text based on that prompt. You can also adjust the settings for the language model, such as the maximum length of the generated text and the temperature of the output.

Try it out and see what kind of interesting text you can generate with OpenAI's GPT-3 language model!
